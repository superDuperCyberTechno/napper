          Checks

        <p>
          When a player character want to achieve any non-trivial action the following happens:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The game master chooses a difficulty (see table below).
          </li>
          <li>
            The player makes a check against the difficulty, based on the most relevant talent.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Difficulty</td>
            <td>Value</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Very easy</td>
            <td>9</td>
          </tr>

            <td>13</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          To make a check, the player rolls 1d20 and add their talent modifier. If the result is at least as high as the
          difficulty, the action was a success.

                Any check that results in a value of <strong>20 <u>before</u> applying modifier</strong> is a <strong>critical success</strong>.

            <li>
                Any check that results in a value of <strong>less than 1 <u>after</u> applying modifier</strong> is a <strong>critical failure</strong>.

          Powers
        </summary>
        <p>
          Powers represent all supernatural abilities in the game world. In a fantasy setting this would be magic, in a
          cyberpunk setting it could mean implants allowing super speed, retractable wristblades etc.
          Just like weapons and other tools, player characters make a talent assignment for each newly acquired power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Powers are tied to discrete, destructible objects; magic spells is written on scrolls, hacking modules are
          hardcoded into circuit boards, the void bridge is tied to a mystical totem etc.

          Talents

        <p>
          Talents describe the expertise of player characters. Low values being bad, high values being good.
          When you encounter an action that cannot be represented by any existing talent, make up a new talent that fits
          and assign it to the player character. - To do so, note your character class' affinity to the talent and make a talent assignment roll:

          Talents (and their level) persist even if a related item should leave a player character's inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Talents vary greatly in theme and specificity. They represent the use of weapon types, the strength to hold a
          door, health to withstand poison. Pretty much everything that a player character does or uses is expressed
          using talents: <i>Resist poison, Swords, Two-Handed Swords, Climbing, Dodging, Barter, Threaten, Throw, Pistols, Unarmed Combat,
          Fireball, X-Ray Vision, Hide, Sneak, Lockpicking, Lie, Invent, Read,</i> etc.

          Luck
        </summary>
        <p>
          Sometimes, someone has to draw the shortest straw. Who will the hulking beast attack first? Who will get hit
          in the head with the falling potted plant? Who will step in the bear trap? Who will literally draw the
          shortest straw? For this, use <i>Luck</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All player characters start with d6 Luck. If anything unfortunate happens that is not explicitely tied to a
          specific character, the player characters make a luck roll: 1d20 + luck (reroll on ties). The unfortunate
          event
          is inflicted upon the player character with the lowest result who in turn is awarded 1 Luck.
        </p>

        <h3>Meta currency</h3>
        <p>
          Luck is also a meta currency that can be used by players to enhance their chance of success for checks: 1 luck expended will equal to +1 to their modifier. Expended luck must be resolved prior to rolling.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to talent checks, Luck can also be used in this way to increase the result of talent assignment rolls.
        </p>

        <h3>Critical success award</h3>
        <p>
          It also acts as a way for game masters to award players characters with 1 Luck if they roll a critical success
          with no obvious extra benefits to apply.

          When the game master deems it so (usually after a gruelling encounter) the player characters can try to
          upgrade a talent they have used.
          To do so, they make another talent assignment roll (see Talents). If the result is higher than the current
          level of the talent, they increase the talent level by 1.
          Alternatively, they can choose to increase their health by 1 without any check.

          Body armor has health of its own. All damage sustained while wearing armor is transferred directly to the
          armor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shields work the same way but must be wielded to have any effect (this takes up one hand). However, unlike
          body armor, damage sustained is optional.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some damage explicitely ignore armor and damages the player character health directly.
