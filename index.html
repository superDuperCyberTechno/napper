        <summary>Introduction</summary>
        <p>
          Napper is a streamlined, theme-agnostic, d20-based, roll-over, tabletop role-playing game system. In only
          consists of rules in its rawest form, for specific information on monsters, items, classes etc. refer to an
          module.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          A set of 7 standard polyhedral dice: 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12 and 1d20 (d100 is not needed). Pen and paper.
          That's it.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Modules</h3>
        <p>
          Napper can only be played by using a module. - These provide everything but the rules (contained herein).

        <summary>Checks</summary>
        <p>
          When a player character want to achieve any non-trivial action the following happens:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The game master chooses a difficulty (see table below).
          </li>
          <li>
            The player makes a check against the difficulty, based on the most relevant Talent (see <i>Talents</i>).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Difficulty</td>
            <td>Value</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Very easy</td>
            <td>9</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Easy</td>
            <td>10</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Default/normal</td>
            <td>11</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Hard</td>
            <td>12</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Very hard</td>
            <td>13</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br>

        <p>
          To make a check, the player rolls 1d20 and add their talent modifier. If the result is at least as high as the
          difficulty, the action was a success.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a rule of thumb, all dice rolls are handled by players. The only job of the game master is to determine a
          difficulty for the players to beat. This include combat where agressors are also simply represented by a
          difficulty.

        <summary>Criticals</summary>
        <p>
          <i>Critical failures</i>, - and <i>successes</i> represent actions with exceptional outcomes.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Critical failures</strong> are failures with additional negative consequences
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Critical successes</strong> are successes with additional positive effects
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The actual outcomes are mostly up to the game master, but modules can supply specifics to particular
          actions. Combat and powers are some categories that are usually supplied with specifics on criticals.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Defaults</h3>
        <p>
          Some criticals feature default outcomes. Unless otherwise noted any outcome is in addition to the following:

        <h3>How to determine</h3>
        <p>
          To determine if a critical event has happened, refer to the below list, ordered from highest, - to lowest
          priority:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Rolling a 1 or a 20 <strong>before applying modifier</strong> is a critical failure, - or success,
            respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rolling less than 1 or more than 20 <strong>after applying modifier</strong> is a critical failure, - or
            success, respectively.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <summary>Talents</summary>
        <p>
          Talents describe the expertise of player characters. Low values being bad, high values being good.
          When you encounter an action that cannot be represented by any existing talent, make up a new talent that fits
          and assign it to the player character. The talent value is determined using a d8:
        </p>
        <br>

        <br>

        <p>
          Players can have modifiers (-1/+1) for certain talents. Remember to add it to their assignment rolls.
          Talents (and their level) persist even if a related item should leave a player character's inventory.
          Talents can be upgraded using using Favor (see <i>Favor</i>).
        </p>
      </details>

      <details open>
        <summary>Favor</summary>
        <p>
          All player characters start with d6 Favor. If anything unfortunate happens that is not explicitly tied to a
          specific character, the player(s) with the lowest Favor suffer the consequences and is awarded 1 Favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          If no obvious boon can be applied to a critical success, players are awarded 1 Favor.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Upgrading talents</h3>
        <p>
          Expending 3 Favor allows players to make a new talent assignment roll (see <i>Talents</i>) for any one Talent
          they choose. If the resulting modifier is higher than the current talent modifier, increase it permanently by
          1.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Increasing health</h3>
        <p>
          Expending 3 favor allows players to roll a d12, if the result is higher than their current maximum health,
          they
          increase it by 1.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Boosting rolls</h3>
        <p>
          Favor can be used by players to enhance their chance of success when making Checks: 1 Favor expended will
          equal +1 to their modifier. Expended Favor must be resolved prior to rolling.

        <summary>Powers</summary>
        <p>
          Powers represent all supernatural abilities in the game world. In a fantasy setting this would be magic, in a
          cyberpunk setting it could mean implants allowing super speed, retractable wristblades etc.
          Just like weapons and other tools, player characters make a talent assignment for each newly acquired power.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          Powers are tied to discrete, destructible objects; magic spells is written on scrolls, hacking modules are
          hardcoded into circuit boards etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Powers are usually provided with specific outcomes for criticals. Refer to modules for these.

        <p>
          Offense and defense is both handled with weapon talents (or for example <i>Unarmed Combat</i> if no weapon
          equipped).
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          A trained soldier attacks a player character. Being trained, difficulty is 12. The player character has a
          sword equipped with talent Sword +3. The player rolls a 10. Thus, the sum is 13 and the player character
          succesfully deflects the attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each round consists of 1 action. This can be attacking, moving, using a power etc.

        <summary>Armor</summary>
        <p>
          Armor is described using a number between 0 and 3. Any armor is noted as "A" followed by its value (A1, A2,
          A3).
          Whenever damage is sustained, subtract the armor value before subtracting the result from health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Armor can never reduce damage lower than 1.
          Some damage explicitly ignore armor and damages the player character health directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Armor can be damaged. If that happens, the armor value is reduced by 1.

        <p>
          When the game master is uncertain how a non-player character is going to react, they can make a reaction roll
          using 1d20:
        </p>
        <br>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>
              Reaction
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nowrap">1</td>
            <td>Extreme animosity, will attack</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nowrap">2</td>
            <td>Angered, very suspicious</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nowrap">3</td>
            <td>Dismissive, prefer to be left alone</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nowrap">4</td>
            <td>Interested, wants more information</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nowrap">5</td>
            <td>Friendly, will help without much incentive</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nowrap">6</td>
            <td>Elated, will do a lot and ask few questions</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br>

        <p>
          The game master can apply modifiers to the reaction roll if there are circumstances that could have an impact
          on it.

        <p>
          Enemies are described using a die. This die represents their damage and health. When creating the enemy, roll
          the die and assign the result as its health. For armor, roll 2d4 and subtract the lowest value from the
          highest.
