                    5 six-sided dice. Exactly 1 of these dice must be distinguishable from the rest - this die is you base die. 4 black and 1 white is perfect.

                    When a player character want to achieve any non-trivial action the following happens: 
                    First, the game master chooses a difficulty of 4, 5 or 6 (4 being easy, 5 being the default and 6 being hard). 
                    Then, the player makes a check against the difficulty, based on the most relevant talent.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To make a check, the player roll as many dice as the used talent's level - one of these dice must be the base die.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    If <strong>any</strong> of the rolled dice has a value of at least as much as the difficulty, the check was a success. Otherwise it was a failure.
                    If the base die shows a 1, the check is deemed critical. Depending on the overall outcome, this might be very positive or horribly bad.

                    Talents describe the expertise of player characters. Low values being bad, high values being good.
                    When you encounter an action that cannot be represented by any existing talent, make up a new talent that fits and assign it to the player character. - To do so, roll a d6, add modifier and assign the resulting level to the talent:

                        A player character picks up an axe. We do not know how well this character uses an axe, so we make up a new talent for them; Axes. As the character is a warrior, they gain +1 to melee weapon talent assignments. They roll a 4 which equates to 5 with the +1 modifier, thus - by referring the table above - the character now has the talent Axes 2.
                        If a wizard picked up the same axe (or any other melee weapon), they would need to make a talent assignment using a -1 modifier, thus rolling a 4 would give them Axes 1.

                    Talents persist even if a related item should leave a player character's inventory.

                    Talents vary greatly in theme and specificity. They represent the use of weapon types, the strength to hold a door, health to withstand poison. Everything that a player character does is expressed using talents. Here's a list of potential talents: Resist poison, Swords, Climbing, Dodging, Barter, Threaten, Throw, Shoot, Unarmed Combat, Fireball, X-Ray Vision, Hide, Sneak, Lockpicking, Lie, Invent, Read, etc.

                    When the game master deems it so (usually after a gruelling encounter) the player characters can try to upgrade a talent.
                    To do so, they make another talent assignment roll (see Talents). If the result is higher than the current level of the talent, they increase the talent level by 1.
                    Alternatively, they can choose to increase their health by 1 without any check.

                    Powers represent all supernatural abilities in the game world. In a fantasy setting this would be magic, in a cyberpunk setting it could mean implants allowing super speed, retractable wristblades etc.
                    Just like weapons and other tools, player characters make a talent assignment for each newly acquired power.

                    <div class="example">
                        A wizard finds a new scroll: Fireball. They have not seen this spell before so they make a talent assignment. Since they are a wizard, they gain a +2 modifier for power talent assignments.
                        The player rolls a 3, resulting in a total of 5 which in turn translates to the value of 2. Thus, they now have a new talent: Fireball 2.
