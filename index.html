                        When a player character want to achieve any non-trivial action the following happens:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The game master chooses a difficulty (see table below).

                        <li>
                            The player makes a check against the difficulty, based on the most relevant talent.

                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        To make a check, the player roll as many dice as the used talent's level - one of these dice must be the base die.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There's only 2 things to note after rolling a check:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            If <strong>any</strong> of the rolled dice has a value of <strong>at least as much as the difficulty</strong>, the check was a <strong>success</strong>. Otherwise it was a failure.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the <strong>base die shows 1</strong>, the check is deemed <strong>critical</strong>. Depending on the overall outcome (see previous bullet point), this might be very positive or horribly bad.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="example">
                        A player character wants to climb a house. The game master does not have any inclination to decide on the difficulty, so the default (5) is chosen. The player character uses the talent Climb 2 to achieve the action, rolling 2d6 (base die and a d6): Base die shows a 3 and the other die is a 6. Thus - because of the 6 - the attempt was a success.
                        Had the base die shown a 1, the action would have been deemed critical and because the overall outcome was a success the player character would've climbed the wall with overwhelming success. In this case, the player character is awarded 1 Luck as there's no amazing extra benefits to gather from the critically successful action.

                        Talents describe the expertise of player characters. Low values being bad, high values being good.
                        When you encounter an action that cannot be represented by any existing talent, make up a new talent that fits and assign it to the player character. - To do so, note your character class' affinity to the talent and roll the resulting die.

                        A player character picks up an axe. We do not know how well this character uses an axe, so we make up a new talent for them; Axes. 
                        The character is a warrior, thus they have superior affinity for melee weapons. They roll a 4, thus the character now has a new talent: Axes 4.
                        If a wizard picked up the same axe (or any other melee weapon), the outcome would never exceed 3 because of their inferior affinity for all weapons.

                        Talents vary greatly in theme and specificity. They represent the use of weapon types, the strength to hold a door, health to withstand poison. Pretty much everything that a player character does or uses is expressed using talents: Resist poison, Swords, Climbing, Dodging, Barter, Threaten, Throw, Pistols, Unarmed Combat, Fireball, X-Ray Vision, Hide, Sneak, Lockpicking, Lie, Invent, Read, etc.

                        When the game master deems it so (usually after a gruelling encounter) the player characters can try to upgrade a talent they have used.
                        To do so, they make another talent assignment roll (see Talents). If the result is higher than the current level of the talent, they increase the talent level by 1.
                        Alternatively, they can choose to increase their health by 1 without any check.

                        Body armor counts as 1 huge item and has health of its own. All damage sustained while wearing armor is transferred directly to the armor. Shields work the same way but must be wielded to have any effect. However, unlike body armor, damage sustained is optional. Some damage explicitely ignore armor and damages the player character health directly.

                        Sometimes a slight modifier can be added to a reaction roll (+1, +2, -1 or -2). Positive modifiers will yield better results for players, negative modifiers will do the opposite.

The unfortunate event is inflicted upon the player character with the lowest result who in turn is awarded 1 Luck.

                        Luck is also a meta currency that can be used by players to enhance their chance of success: Player characters can add 1 additional die (only 1) to any check by deducting 1 luck from their luck pool.

                        It also acts as a way for game masters to award players characters with 1 Luck if they roll a critical success with no obvious extra benefits to apply.
