                    <p>
                        Napper is a streamlined, theme-agnostic, d20-based, roll-over, tabletop role-playing game system. In only consists of rules in its rawest form, for specific information on monsters, items, classes etc. refer to an expansion.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>
                    <p>
                        A set of 7 standard polyhedral dice: 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12 and 1d20 (d100 is not needed). Pen and paper. That's it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Nomenclature</h3>
                    <p>
                        When playing Napper, you will frequently be asked to roll dice. There are 2 ways to 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>d-notation</strong> (1d6, 2d4, 1d8 etc.): Used for sums (shorthand for "1 die, 6 sides", "2 dice, 4 sides", "1 die, 8 sides" etc.)
                        <br>
                        Roll the amount of dice that correspond to the number <u>before</u> <i>d</i>. The size (number of sides) of the dice is determined by the number <u>after</u> <i>d</i>.
                        <br>
                        Example: An unfortunate explosion does 2d4 damage. Roll 2 four-sided dice and add all the results to get the damage the explosion did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>i-notation</strong> (1i4, 3i8, 4i20 etc.): Used for probabilites (shorthand for "1 in 4", "3 in 8", "4 in 20" etc.)
                        <br>
                        Roll one die, its size (number of sides) is determined by the number <u>after</u> <i>i</i>. If the result is not higher than the number before <i>i</i>, the result is true. Otherwise it is false.
                        <br>
                        Example: A barrel of volatile explosives has a probability of 3i8 to explode. Roll one eight-sided die (1d8), if the result is 1, 2 or 3 the result is true (the barrel explodes). Otherwise the outcome is false (the barrel does not explode).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Napper can only be played by using an expansion that

                    <p>
                        When a player character want to achieve any non-trivial action the following happens:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The game master chooses a difficulty (see table below).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The player makes a check against the difficulty, based on the most relevant talent.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Difficulty</td>
                            <td>Value</td>

                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To make a check, the player rolls 1d20 and add their talent modifier. If the result is at least as high as the
                        difficulty, the action was a success.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a rule of thumb, all dice rolls are handled by players. The only job of the game master is to determine a difficulty for the players to beat. This include combat where agressors are also simply represented by a difficulty.

                        <i>Critical failures</i>, - and <i>successes</i> represent actions with exceptional outcomes. <strong>Critical failures are failures with additional negative consequences</strong> and <strong>critical successes are successes with additional positive effects</strong>. 
                        The actual outcomes are mostly up to the game master, but expansions can supply specifics to particular actions. Combat and powers are some categories that are usually supplied with specifics on criticals.

                    <h3>How to determine</h3>
                    <p>
                        To determine if a critical event has happened, refer to the below list, ordered from highest, - to lowest priority:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Rolling a 1 or a 20 <strong>before applying modifier</strong> is a critical failure, - or success, respectively.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rolling less than 1 or more than 20 <strong>after applying modifier</strong> is a critical failure, - or success, respectively.
                        </li>

                        Talents describe the expertise of player characters. Low values being bad, high values being good.
                        When you encounter an action that cannot be represented by any existing talent, make up a new talent that fits
                        and assign it to the player character. - To do so, note your character class' affinity to the talent and make a talent assignment roll:

                    <p>
                        Talents vary greatly in theme and specificity. They represent the use of weapon types, the strength to hold a
                        door, health to withstand poison. Pretty much everything that a player character does or uses is expressed
                        using talents: <i>Resist poison, Swords, Two-Handed Swords, Climbing, Dodging, Barter, Threaten, Throw, Pistols, Unarmed Combat,
                            Fireball, X-Ray Vision, Hide, Sneak, Lockpicking, Lie, Invent, Read,</i> etc.

                        Sometimes, someone has to draw the shortest straw. Who will the hulking beast attack first? Who will get hit
                        in the head with the falling potted plant? Who will step in the bear trap? Who will literally draw the
                        shortest straw? For this, use <i>Luck</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All player characters start with d6 Luck. If anything unfortunate happens that is not explicitely tied to a
                        specific character, the player characters make a luck roll: 1d20 + luck (reroll on ties). The unfortunate
                        event
                        is inflicted upon the player character with the lowest result who in turn is awarded 1 Luck.

                    <h3>Meta currency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Luck is also a meta currency that can be used by players to enhance their chance of success for checks: 1 luck expended will equal to +1 to their modifier. Expended luck must be resolved prior to rolling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to talent checks, Luck can also be used in this way to increase the result of talent assignment rolls.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Critical success award</h3>
                    <p>
                        It also acts as a way for game masters to award players characters with 1 Luck if they roll a critical success
                        with no obvious extra benefits to apply.

                        Powers represent all supernatural abilities in the game world. In a fantasy setting this would be magic, in a
                        cyberpunk setting it could mean implants allowing super speed, retractable wristblades etc.
                        Just like weapons and other tools, player characters make a talent assignment for each newly acquired power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Powers are tied to discrete, destructible objects; magic spells is written on scrolls, hacking modules are
                        hardcoded into circuit boards, the void bridge is tied to a mystical totem etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Powers are usually provided with specific outcomes for criticals. Refer to expansion for these.
